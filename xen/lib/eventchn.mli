(** Event channel interface. *)

type handle
(** An initialised event channel interface. *)

type t
(** A local event channel. *)

val to_int : t -> int
(** [to_int evtchn] is the port number of [evtchn]. *)

val of_int : int -> t
(** [of_int n] is the [n]th event channel. *)

val init: unit -> handle
(** [init ()] is an initialised event channel interface. Will never
    throw an exception. *)

val close: handle -> int
(** [close h] closes [h] and returns 0. *)

val notify : handle -> t -> unit
(** [notify h c] notifies the [t]. *)

val bind_interdomain : handle -> int -> int -> t
(** [bind_interdomain h domid remote_port] is a local event channel
    connected to domid:remote_port. On error it will return -1. *)

val bind_unbound_port : handle -> int -> t
(** [bind_unbound_port h remote_domid] is a new event channel awaiting
    an interdomain connection from [remote_domid]. On error it will
    return -1. *)

val bind_dom_exc_virq : handle -> t
(** [bind_dom_exc_virq h] binds a local event channel to the
    VIRQ_DOM_EXC (domain exception VIRQ). On error it will return
    -1. *)

val unbind : handle -> t -> unit
(** [unbind h c] unbinds [c]. *)

val unmask : handle -> t -> unit
(** [unmask h c] unmasks [c]. *)

(** {2 Xen specific functions} *)

val is_valid : t -> bool
(** [is_valid c] is true if [t] is bound. Bindings are invalidated
    after a domain resume. *)

val look_for_work : unit -> bool
(** [look_for_work ()] latches pending event channels into the activations
    bitmap so that Activations.run will see them. Returning true means
    some work is pending, so we should run Activations.run. *)
