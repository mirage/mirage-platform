(** Event channels handlers. *)

type event
(** identifies the an event notification received from xen *)

val program_start: event
(** represents an event which 'fired' when the program started *)

val after: Eventchn.t -> event -> event Lwt.t
(** [next channel event] blocks until the system receives an event
    newer than [event] on channel [channel]. If an event is received
    while we aren't looking then this will be remembered and the
    next call to [after] will immediately unblock. If the system
    is suspended and then resumed, all event channel bindings are invalidated
    and this function will fail with Generation.Invalid *)

(** {2 Low level interface} *)

val wait : Eventchn.t -> unit Lwt.t
(** [wait evtchn] is a cancellable thread that will wake up when
    [evtchn] is notified. Cancel it if you are no longer interested in
    waiting on [evtchn]. Note that if the notification is sent before
    [wait] is called then the notification is lost. *)

val run : Eventchn.handle -> unit
(** [run ()] goes through the event mask and activate any events,
    potentially spawning new threads. This function is called by
    [Main.run]. Do not call it unless you know what you are doing. *)

val resume : unit -> unit
(** [resume] needs to be called after the unikernel is
    resumed. However, this function is automatically called by
    {!Sched.suspend}. Do NOT use it unless you know what you are
    doing. *)

val dump : unit -> unit
(** [dump ()] prints internal state to the console for debugging *)
