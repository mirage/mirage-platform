* [xen] Io_page.string_blit has now an interface similar to String.blit
* [xen] Console.write_s has been renamed Console.write_all
* [xen] Gnttab.unmap_exn now throws an exception on failure, like the
  xenctrl version. This makes it possible to run the same blkback code
  in kernelspace and userspace.

0.8.1 (27-Mar-2013):
* [xen] Fix the Xen block interface to wait for init correctly.

0.8.0 (12-Feb-2013):
* Remove `mir-build` script as the Mirari builder does its job now.
* [xen] add Str module C stubs, adapted to work in the Xen backend.

0.7.2 (08-Feb-2013):
* [xen] Fix the size of the start-of-day Xenstore and console rings.
* Quieten the verbosity of devices sleeping in Xen, to avoid console
  overflow situations.
* Install the packed `cmx` along with the `cmxa` to ensure that the
  compiler can do cross-module optimization (this is not a fatal error,
  but will impact performance if the `cmx` file is not present).
  
0.7.1 (20-Dec-2012):
* [unix] Update devices API to use Cstruct 0.6.0

0.7.0 (20-Dec-2012):
* [xen] Add support for VM suspend/resume/migrate
* [xen] Support for multiple network interfaces
* [xen] Use new shared-memory-ring, removing old builtin version.
  This is all OCaml except for the memory barrier assembly instructions.
* Update Cstruct to new API in 0.6.0

0.6.1 (15-Dec-2012):
* [xen] Add an unused ?dev parameter to Netif.create to match
  the UNIX version.
* [script] Add a mir-build script which converts a native output
  object into a Xen kernel.  It does command-line parsing to be
  compatible with other Xen outputs in the future (such as the
  kFreeBSD or Javascript backends, when they are ready).

0.6.0 (11-Dec-2012):
* [xen] refresh to ocaml-4.00.1 runtime.  You *must* use the
  correct OPAM switch to match versions, or bad things will
  happen when the resulting binary is run.

0.5.0 (10-Dec-2012):
* [xen] Fix spurious floating point exceptions on some machines.
* [ns3] Add NS3-based simulator backend.
* [unix] Add pcap-based Ethernet access in addition to tuntap.

0.4.1 (04-Nov-2012):
* [xen] fix incorrect reference counting in Io_pages that could
  potentially cause pages to be reused too early.
* [xen] move Xenstore protocol implementation out to a separate
  library that provides it as a functor.
* [unix] ignore SIGPIPE in the OS.Main.run function.

0.4.0 (11-Sep-2012):
* [xen] Add support for mapping and unmapping grant references
* [xen] Support Xen 4.2 reserved console and xenstore maps.
* [xen] Switch the Xenstore and console rings over to use cstruct.
* [xen] Add Evtchn virq interface for stub xenstored.
* [xen] Add Evtchn.unbind.
* [netif] fix checksum calculation code for odd-sized packets.
 
0.3.0 (04-Sep-2012):
* Initial public release.
